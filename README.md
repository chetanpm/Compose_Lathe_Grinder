Humans have the advantage of teching fellow humans their ingenuity and creating newer ways of doing stuff. Openly sharing our learnings with thousands of interested people enabled us to reach to the state of power over other organisms.

I am using Autodesk Fusion 360 (free for students, hobbyists and startups) to design. Anyone willing to help with the design can do so with the Fusion's built-in team collaboration tools or wait till the design is complete to download all the part drawings and bulid the machine yourself.
